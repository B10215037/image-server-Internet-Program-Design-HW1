environment:
	linux (I use lubuntu)

compile:
	gcc server.c -o server.out
	gcc client.c -o client.out

run:
	./server.out <port> <image 1 name> <image 2 name>
	./client.out <IP> <port> <download image number(1 or 2)> <save image name>

note:
	* server won't stop until user close it, press "ctrl + c" to stop it.
	* client.out save image at current directory (the same directory as client.out)
